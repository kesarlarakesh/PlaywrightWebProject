# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactoring

1. **Consolidated Allure Utilities**
   - Created a unified `allure-utils.js` script that handles all Allure-related operations
   - Created a unified `allure-utils.bat` batch file for Windows users
   - Updated package.json with new npm scripts

2. **Removed Redundant Files**
   - Removed `cleanup-custom-reporter.bat` which was no longer needed
   - Identified other files that could be removed in future updates

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Updated ALLURE-README.md with new commands
   - Created ALLURE-UTILS-README.md with detailed information about the refactoring
   - Added more code comments for better maintainability

4. **Enhanced ReporterManager**
   - Improved code comments for better clarity
   - Removed any references to custom reporters

5. **Removed Screenshots Directory**
   - Previously moved screenshot functionality to save directly to allure-results
   - Created cleanup utilities for the old screenshots directory

## Future Improvements

1. **Remove Deprecated Files**
   - After team members have migrated to new utilities, remove:
     - allure-with-screenshots.bat
     - generate-allure-report.bat
     - open-report.bat
     - view-report.bat
     - view-report.js
     - import-screenshots.js

2. **Further Script Consolidation**
   - Consider consolidating run-tests.bat, run-tests-headless.bat, run-tests-headed.bat
   - Create a similar unified script pattern for test execution

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Update any CI/CD pipelines to use the new utilities

## Unused Code Analysis

A script `identify-unused-files.js` has been created to help identify which files are candidates for removal in the future. This script can be run periodically to monitor technical debt.
